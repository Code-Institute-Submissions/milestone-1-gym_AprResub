![Mockup](assets/wireframes/mockup.png)

## Purpose:

Fortitude gym is fictional gym created using HTML and CSS for my first milestone project. It will provide users with information on the gym and it's services for existing and potential members.

## User Stories:

### As a user, I wish to be able to: 

Easily navigate the site to find what I need.

Find out what services are provided.

Find location and contact details.

See what's included in membership.

### As the site owner, I wish to:

Aquire new customers and provide existing customers with any relevant information.

## Structure:

All pages will consist of a navigation bar, a callout with a sign up button for membership deals and special offers and a footer with contact and membership details and links to social media.

### Wireframe mockups:

## Features:

The navbar will bring users to their desired location.

The join now button will trigger a pop out modal prompting users to enter their details.

The social media links will all direct users to the associated website in a new window. 

## Technologies:

* Bootstrap 4 was used for layout, to reduce navbar to hamburger menu and for the modal popout. https://getbootstrap.com/

* Google fonts was used for the fonts used on site(Piedra an Roboto). https://fonts.google.com/

* Font Awesome was used for the social media icon links and also for the hamburger menu icon on mobile. https://fontawesome.com/

## Testing:

* The nav links bring you to the desired location. No dead links, modals work as expected.

* The join now button triggers the modal - appropriate inputs are required.

* The social media links bring you to the corresponding page in a new tab.

#### Bug fixes

* Not many interesting/noteworthy bugs to speak of, more time experimenting with styling

* Occasional contrast issues found with dev tools but easy fix with lighter shades of same color
